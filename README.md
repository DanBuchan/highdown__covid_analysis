# Purpose

This small repositiory contains the R code used to generate the tables and figures in the paper and any ancillary information. Primary data and any intermediary files which could be used to reconstruct the primary data are not included. Data is available on request from radha.kothari@nhs.net

## Analysis 

1. prisoner_analysis.R - reads in the primary data, performs analysis, outputs results and intermediary files
2. annotate_correlations.py - takes the outcome/predictor correlations and annotates them as per their p-values
3. Summary of prisoner variables for inferential statistics.docx - list of Predictor and Outcome variables for prisoners
4. Summary of staff variables for inferential statistics.docx - list of Predictor and Outcome variables for staff

## Results

1. correlations.xsls - predictor/outcome correlation matrix and p-value matrix in excel format
2. prisoner_correlations.csv - predictor/outcome correlation matrix, csv format
3. prisoner_corr_pvalues.csv - predictor/outcome correlation significance matrix, csv format
4. prisoner_annotated.csv - predictor/outcome correlation matrix annotated by pvalue, csv format
5. staff_correlations.csv - predictor/outcome correlation matrix, csv format
6. staff_corr_pvalues.csv - predictor/outcome correlation significance matrix, csv format
7. staff_annotated.csv - predictor/outcome correlation matrix annotated by pvalue, csv format
